### Day 1: January 30, Monday

This is my first day of #100daysofcode. I decided to start this challenge because for the last year I've been doing lots of tutorials, and I want to start making projects so I can get a job as a Front End Developer. Also, I wanted to do this challenge because I needed a distraction of what is going on arount the globe regarding DT. It was stressing me out, so I'm back to coding. Today I worked on the Random Quote App from freeCodeCamp.com. I was able to get random background colors and the color to match.

**mood**: feeling good for being first day.

### Day 2: January 31, Tuesday

Today I implemented buttons and twitter icon on the Random Quote App. I did a bit of Javascript to change the background of the buttons, but I haven't started on the Random Quote API. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to work more on JS.

**mood**: feeling a bit under the weather (sick), so I couldn't advance very much on the app.

### Day 3: February 1, Wednesday

At first I wasn't sure how I was going to implement the API into my app, but after going through a [tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) on Udacity, things became a lot clearer. The buttons are not fully functional, and that's what I'm planning to work on tomorrow morning.

**mood**: I was feeling a little better than yesterday in regards to the cold that I have, and I was able to concentrate more on the JavaScript side. Overall I was feeling happy and eagered to learn new stuff.

### Day 4: February 2, Thursday

Tried to finish the Random Quote App, but I couldn't get to re-tweet the quote. I will work on it a little more on Friday. If anybody has any ideas how to do this or where I can go to learn about it, I appreciate it.

**mood**: I'm still a little sick, but I was able to code for a little bit more than an hour. Donald Trump is still stressing me out.
